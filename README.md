ng-tools
========

collection of useful services/factories/directives/filters I like using in any Angular project, so far contains:

- debounce factory
- include-in-scope directive

## Editing
Build process is done with grunt, so if you want to modify sources, just run:
```
npm install
```

then when you want to get concatenated, minified sources, use
```
grunt
```
